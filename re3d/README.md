# re3d in CONLL format | Entity Extraction
This dataset is based on the re3d dataset, Relationship and Entity Extraction Evaluation Dataset, which has been cleaned and converted to CoNLL 2003 format.

The github project (https://github.com/dstl/re3d) README states:
<pre>
"This dataset was the output of a project carried out by Aleph Insights and
Committed Software on behalf of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory
(Dstl). The project aimed to create a 'gold standard' dataset that could be
used to train and validate machine learning approaches to natural language
processing (NLP); specifically focusing on entity and relationship extraction
relevant to somebody operating in the role of a defence and security
intelligence analyst. The dataset was therefore constructed using documents
and structured schemas that were relevant to the defence and security analysis
domain."
</pre>
And:
<pre>
"The dataset comprised task-specific documents focused on the topic of the
conflict in Syria and Iraq;
The dataset included a range of source and document types, which had differing
levels of relevance to the overall â€˜topic' of the dataset and possessed
differing entity densities (i.e. some documents containing a high concentration
of instances with others containing a lower concentration)"
