# 20 Newsgroups dataset - Classification
##Description

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, for his [Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781558603776500487) paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.
